They should be moulded and shaped to meet the needs and opinions of today/ The Discipline of Law is a fascinating account of Lord Denning\\\'s personal contribution to the changing face of English law in this century. It is divided into seven main parts each concentrating on one area of the law in which that change has been most marked. In speaking of the Discipline of Law, I use the word in the sense given in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary of \\\'Instruction imparted to disciples or scholars\\\'. But I have no disciples: and scholars are few. Yet I use the word so as to show that I wish to impart instruction - instruction, that is, in the principles of law as they have been, as they are, and as they should be. My theme is that the principles of law laid down by the Judges in the 19th century - however suited to social conditions of that time - are not suited to the social necessities and social opinion of the 20th century. They should be moulded and shaped to meet the needs and opinion of today. In pursuit of this theme I have taken some of the principles where progress has been most marked: and in which I myself have taken some part. Not, I hope, out of conceit, but because I happen to be well acquainted with them. I have put forward proposals which have had a mixed reception. Some of them have come to be accepted during my time. Some have been rejected. Others have not been accepted as yet. Most of them have found their way into the Law Reports. So recently I determined to collect them together in a book. I have arranged them, chapter by chapter, according to the subject in hand. I have quoted extensively from my judgments and connected them together by a running commentary in the hope that these proposals may be discussed in the Law Schools: and perhaps in future years find acceptance. But this book is outside my judicial work. All I write now must be treated with reserve.	  ', '0', '0', 'noimage.jpg', '1', '1', '2007-07-01', '2007-09-01');

In this respect it completes the series of books starting with The Discipline of Law in 1979, and followed successively by The Due Process of Law and the sensational What Next in the Law. The new work contains, in Book One, a sequel to Lord Denning\\\'s autobiography, The Family Story. In it he tells with disarming and touching candour of the circumstances of the publication and withdrawal of What Next in the Law and of his decision to retire from the office of Master of the Rolls. He also tells of his activities since retirement, including his advice to householders during the water strike, and the consternation caused by the judgment in the Court of Appeal in the case of the Sikh Boy\\\'s Turban. Book Two contains a fascinating account of some of the leading contentious legal issues of the day, in which he has played a singular part. He discusses the problems of statutory interpretation and explains the legal significance of the new dichotomy between public law and private law as set out in his judgment in O\\\'Reilly v Mackman in 1982. He traces the bumpy course of trade union legislation from 1906 to the present day, and places his own, often contentious, judgments on trade union matters in the context of that legislation. Finally he identifies the series of cases on which he and the Court of Appeal have been, or have appeared to be, on a collision course with the House of Lords. He ends, however, happily enough, with Geo Mitchell Ltd v Finney Seeds Ltd, the last of his cases to go on appeal to the House of Lords, in which his judgment was, for a change, enthusiastically endorsed by the House of Lords.', '0', '0', '8131705390.jpg', '1', '1', '2007-07-01', '2007-07-15');

	1    Plan every writing project by breaking it upand carry it out in stages.
	2   When first working on a writing project, let the madman run loose for a while.
	3    Begin the architectural planning by stating the issues. Before writing in earnest, figure out how many issues there areand what they are.
	4    Once you\\\'ve drafted issue statements, read more law and take plenty of notes. Tweak or even rewrite the issues as you continue researching. Then organize the issues from most important to least important.
	5	Outline your brief, but start with nonlinear outlining.
	6	Write a draft straight through, without stopping to edit. Let it sit awhile before editing.
	7	Proof carefully; have several others proof carefully; learn and use standard editing marks.
	B.    CONVEYING THE BIG PICTURE
	8    Frame the deep issues at the outset so that you meet the 90-second test.
	9   Phrase your issues in separate sentences. Don\\\'t start with whether or any other interrogative word.
	10    Limit your issues to 75 words apiece.
	11   Write fair but persuasive issues that have only one answer. Cast each issue as a syllogism. If you have several issues, give each one with a concise, neutral heading.
	12   Weave facts into your issues to make them concrete.
	13    If you don\\\'t open with explicit issue statements, sum up the issues and your theme in a short introduction.
	14   Highlight the reasons for the conclusion you\\\'re urging.
	15   Make your points as simple as possible, but no simpler.
C.    MARCHING FORWARD THROUGH SOUND PARAGRAPHS
	16    Begin a paragraph with a topic sentence. Don\\\'t end the preceding paragraph with what should be the next paragraph\\\'s topic sentence.
	17	Bridge from one paragraph to another.
	18	Connect your sentences smoothly to one another. Avoid \\\"bumps\\\" in the prose.
	19	Ease your readers\\\' way by providing signposts.
	20	Break up long, complex sentences. Shoot for an average sentence length of 20 words.
	21	Avoid tiresome repetitions that hurt the mind\\\'s ear.
	22    Put all your citations in footnotes, while saying in the text what authority you\\\'re relying on. But ban substantive footnotes.
	23   If you must cite in text, make the citations unobtrusive.
	24   Say something about the critical cases you cite: show how and why they apply. For other cases, be satisfied with a simple citation.
	25    Use parenthetical case explanations merely to show why you\\\'re citing the casesnot to
present your argument.
EDITING FOR BRISK, UNCLUTTERED SENTENCES
	26	Relax the tone: eliminate the jargon known as \\\"legalese.\\\"
	27	Avoid overparticulari/ation.
	28	Populate your sentences. Use real names (not procedural labels) for parties.
	29	Work hard to replace foe-verbs with action verbs.
	30	Know what the passive voice is, and minimize it.
	31	Uncover buried verbsespecially words ending in -lion.
	32    When given the choice between a passive-voice verb and a buried verb, choose the passive voice.
	33   Eliminate unnecessary prepositional phrasesespecially those beginning with of.
	34    Don\\\'t separate a short subject from its verb with a modifying phrase. Instead, start, the sentence with the modifier.
	35	Don\\\'t separate a verb from its object.
	36	To write forcefully, end your sentences with punch.
	37	Cut filler phrases such as there is and there are.
	38	Eliminate throat-clearing phrases.
	39	Ruthlessly cut unnecessary words.
	40    Keep your sentences to one main thought, but combine related sentences if doing so will minimi/e choppiness.
	41    Use parallel constructions whenever you canbut make sure the ideas are really parallel.
CHOOSING THE BEST WORDS
	42	Replace humdrum phrases with snappy ones that spark interest.
	43	Slate your ideas freshly; use cliches only when you can turn them to good advantage.
	44	Strive for distinctive nouns and verbsminimi/ing adjectives and adverbs.
	45    Save syllables. Shoot for one-syllable words when possible; failing thai, aim for two-syllable words.
	46    Avoid heavy connectors.
	47    Simplify wordy prepositions: \\\\vith respect to, as to, in order to, in connection with, etc.
	48    Don\\\'t use However to start a sentence: use But instead, move however inside the sentence, or collapse the preceding sentence into an Although-<:\\\\ause.
	49    Strike pursuant to Irom your vocabulary.
	50    Use that reslriclively, which nonrestrictively.

CANCELLATIONS

Order cancellation may be accepted by DK in most of the cases, if your cancellation advice reaches us prior to supply of the material. For subscriptions, credits for the cancelled titles can be given to the customer after the publisher refunds the money for the cancelled item to DK.



CLAIMS & REPORTING :

Each order reaching DK is first recorded under an appropriate system and then processed for procurement/supply, thus leaving no chances of an order remaining unattended. We monitor all outstanding orders at regular intervals. If your ordered items are late in arriving, we intensify our procurement effort -- letting it up only when the customer cancels the same or the publisher informs of its non-availability due to any reason, in which case the customer is duly informed.

Even though we hold huge databases of titles, authors and publishers, at times we may fail to locate the publication information about any of your ordered items. In such cases, we may have to trouble the customer for more particulars on that item.

With the kind of services we give, there are barest minimal chances of your ordered item (whether a subscription periodical or a book/monograph) going astray in its transit -- because we send all material to the clients by \\\'Registered Post\\\' and that too after we ourselves have procured, checked and re-packed it.

Still, if a situation arises in which case you have to claim an ordered item, DK attend to your claims promptly. All claims whether for periodical subscriptions, books/monographs, continuations or back-volumes are responded to immediately with the latest status indications, including the shipment details if the item in question is already in transit. We, of course, expect our customers to allow a sufficient time-margin before claiming an item in view of the procurement efforts involved and international delivery constraints.



CHANGE OF ADDRESS/SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS :

If a change in your address is warranted, we would like to have -- at the earliest, your new address together with details of the old. It is a logical necessity for our recurring transactions with you. And, importantly, we incorporate these changes in our office records without any delay. Should there be any need for a change in any of your shipping/invoicing instructions, we would welcome you to write to us about the same.
